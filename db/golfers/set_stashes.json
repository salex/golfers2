Players can still be added or deleted\n* Scored - The Game is completed. You can still correct \n\nThere was a model Course that was not used and removed. There are also utility models used by me (articles, notices)\n\n* All CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) have a more consistent look and feel.  Buttons use same color and naming conventions.\n* The Schedule Game form has changed from 3 columns to 2 columns\n  * The status form has be moved to the first column along with action buttons \n  * The second column has two sections. The bottom section has all the players. Clicking on a Player name will move to Player to the first section. Click the update button will move the added players to the status form.\n  * Once all players have been added, the Form Teams button will move the Game to a Pending status.\n\nScoring Teams is about the same, just a little more color separation.\n\nPrinting Scorecards now just use plain ol HTML.  Will have to test on your printer - works fine on mine.","slim":null,"hash_data":null,"text_data":null,"date":"2025-05-26","status":null,"created_at":"2025-05-26T23:21:29.202Z","updated_at":"2025-06-02T14:35:15.299Z","due_date":null,"remarks":null},

Some things may look a little different but I'm trying to standardize the look and feel of the application. All dashboards (top (buttons) on most pages) are now consistent.\np  I also tuned what the application looks like on a phone or tablet. It always worked half-assed on a phone in landscape mode, but I've tuned it to work a little better in portrait mode. \np I've tested areas where I made modification, but as I've said before, I have made mistakes. Contact me if you find any problems. \n\np.font-bold Steve Alex \n\np 334.294.6026 \n\np salex@mac.com","hash_data":null,"text_data":null,"date":"2025-05-26","status":"warning","created_at":"2025-05-27T01:41:38.886Z","updated_at":"2025-05-27T15:48:21.215Z","due_date":"2025-05-29","remarks":null},
